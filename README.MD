# Test Automation Framework example

Currently, the project consists of two modules:
  * [aqa-core](https://github.com/gwp78/aqa-core) - contains core implementation
  * [aqa-example-api](https://github.com/gwp78/aqa-example-api) - example project for REST API testing 

To get started with this project you need execute commands:
  * git clone https://github.com/gwp78/aqa-framework.git
  * git submodule init
  * git submodule update

In each folder execute commands:
  * git checkout -b origin/master
  * git pull


(P.S.) If I have more time I will add two approaches for Selenium UI testing:
  * selenium + cucumber + junit + Page object pattern
  * selenium + junit + Common locators class pattern
